Due to time constraints this has not been bug tested but the code is almost all written, please see standard Laravel folders for the database migrations, blade templates, public folder for CSS and JS, app folder for models and controllers and routes for web.php. Built using Laravel 5.4.

It should be possible to preview by just going to the / route
